Template de Arquitectura CI/CD 

Capabilities
1. Scalability: The architecture should be designed to handle the increasing number of users, projects, and workflows that come with scaling up CI/CD processes.

1. Flexibility: The architecture should be flexible enough to allow for easy customization and integration with other tools and technologies.

1. Automation: The architecture should support automation of the CI/CD process to minimize manual intervention and reduce errors.

1. Security: The architecture should prioritize security by implementing measures such as access controls, encryption, and vulnerability scanning.

1. High Availability: The architecture should be designed to ensure high availability and reliability of the CI/CD process, with redundant infrastructure and disaster recovery plans in place.

1. Monitoring and Reporting: The architecture should provide visibility into the CI/CD process with comprehensive monitoring and reporting capabilities.

1. Version Control: The architecture should support version control of source code, artifacts, and configurations to ensure reproducibility of builds and deployments.

1. Test Automation: The architecture should enable automated testing at different stages of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure quality and reduce the risk of errors.

Procesos

1. Code Management: Developers write and commit code changes to a version control system, such as Git.

1. Continuous Integration: The code changes are automatically built and tested in a controlled environment using a CI tool, such as Jenkins or GitLab CI.

1. Artifact Management: The build artifacts, such as binaries and dependencies, are stored in an artifact repository, such as Nexus or Artifactory.

1. Continuous Delivery: The build artifacts are automatically deployed to a pre-production environment, such as staging or UAT, for further testing and validation.

1. Automated Testing: Automated tests are executed on the pre-production environment to validate the build artifacts and ensure that the application meets the requirements.

1. Continuous Deployment: Once the tests pass, the build artifacts are automatically deployed to the production environment, either manually or using a deployment tool, such as Ansible or Terraform.

1. Continuous Monitoring: The production environment is continuously monitored to ensure that the application is functioning as expected and to detect any issues that may arise.
