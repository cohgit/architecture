Every customer who signs a contract with the company gets an Azure environment with multiple virtual machines they can work with. In the current setup, these machines are created manually by the company’s IT team, which is a very long, cumbersome and error-prone process. The company is looking for a way to automate this process, so that a customer can create a virtual machine with a click of a button. In addition, since these are security organizations, the company wants to provide them with secure access using Azure Bastion so that no public IP is set for the virtual machines. By the end of this lab, you need to present a solution that enables a user to create a virtual machine quickly and easily, without any public IP exposed.</p>","{'items': ['Create an ARM template in the Azure Portal', 'Create a new Virtual Machine using an ARM template', 'Customize an ARM template', 'Deploy Azure Bastion', 'Connect to the Virtual Machine using Azure Bastion']}",automate-virtual-machine-creation-and-provide-secure-access-using-arm-template-and-azure-bastion,Automate Virtual Machine Creation and Provide Secure Access Using ARM Template and Azure Bastion,"[{'id': 29720180, 'title': 'Memi Lavi', 'url': '/user/memi-lavi/'}]"
